# Summary
Based on the temperature differences between June and December, there does not seem to be a major difference between temperatures. The first additional query that I would run would be, an analysis on percipitation in order to determine if there is a larger amount of rain in December versus June. This could greatly effect business due to rain. Another query I would consider running would be pulling information about adverse weather events in order to determine if major storms are more common in December or June.
